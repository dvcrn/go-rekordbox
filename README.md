# Golang wrapper for rekordbox databases

This is a wrapper to query and interact with the rekordbox 6 database

Motivation behind this tool is to enable better automation and integration with rekordbox. In previous versions it was possible to just use the rekordbox XML to query data, but since rekordbox 6 this is no longer possible

**Note**: This is a quickly hacked together project and currently **only works on Mac**. Use at own risk, and make a backup of your database.

## What is this exactly?

This wrapper is mostly automatically generated by connecting to the rekordbox database and using it's schema to create a bunch of models. You can find those in `rekordbox/`, and the dumped schema in `db/schema.sql`

## Install

```
go get github.com/dvcrn/go-rekordbox
```

## Usage Example: Query all playlists

Create a new `rekordbox.Client` with `rekordbox.NewClient` and use it to query

```golang
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/dvcrn/go-rekordbox/rekordbox"
)

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()

    // make a new client
	client, err := rekordbox.NewClient()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer client.Close()

    // query all playlists
	playlists, err := client.AllDjmdPlaylist(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	for _, playlist := range playlists {
		fmt.Printf("%s\n", playlist.Name.String)

        // query all songs that are in the playlist
		playlistSongs, err := client.DjmdSongPlaylistByPlaylistID(ctx, playlist.ID)
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}

        // get all songs within the playlist
		for _, playlistSong := range playlistSongs {
			content, err := client.DjmdContentByID(ctx, playlistSong.ContentID)
			if err != nil {
				panic(err)
			}

			fmt.Printf("\t%s\n", content.Title.String)
		}
	}
}
```
